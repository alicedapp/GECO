### What project are you building 

We are building a crypto super app. It's a mobile app that allows other crypto applications to build mobile applications in into our application using React Native. This allows all of the user's funds and crypto applications to be within one app to avoid as much friction as possible. We are heavily focused on User Experience to add more utility to the space that needs it the most, the Blockchain mobile space. 

### Why did you decide to build it 
We decided to build it because we were unhappy with the current solutions out there and were yearning for mobile native apps that had the utilities available on web. This is after extensive research in the space around user's experiences and developer's problems.

### How long will it take 

7 Months

### How much funding are you requesting  

$100,000

### How did you hear about the GEF

We met Stefan in the MetaCartel dinner at DEVCON and he informed us on the GECO program.

## Your Proposal 

### Project description
Our proposal is 1. to use the Gnosis Personal Mulitisig as the de facto smart contract account for the Alice Wallet to be able to utilise Layer 2 UX and scaling solutions that bring better experiences to users 2. To build a mobile native interface for the DutchX exchange so that Gnosis can access users who are spending most of their time on mobile. 

If we are to build more engaging experiences for users we need to start bringing solutions that solve UX problems to fruition by building them out and getting them into user's hands as soon as possible. A major step to reach a pleasurable experience for wallet users is building ontop of Layer 2 solutions. Technologies like decentralized exchanges, state channels, meta transactions, and social recovery are components we see essential to bringing better solutions to users.

Alice is focused on a mobile experience that packs as much utilities into a mobile wallet as possible so that users can experience a jam packed crypto experience in the palm of their hand.
